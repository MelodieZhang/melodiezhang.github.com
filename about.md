Hi, I'm Menghan *[MENG-hahn]*, a master student studying Integrated Innovation for Products & Services at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/iii/degrees/miips/). Previously I worked as a full-time Product Designer at [Zhihu](zhihu.com) for 2 years. Before that, I got my bachelor and master of Software Engineering in Wuhan University. (<strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gbvNpAypowKjFPplD2dlE7VOfnfTlZmQ" target="_blank">Check my resume</a></strong>)

From my academic and professional experience, I learned that innovative solutions hit the sweet spot where viability, desirability and feasibility overlap. For me, design is about solving the right problems, making intentional decisions, measuring the results and keeping iterating and learning.

When I'm not designing, I like to:
- 🍱 Try new recipes and snap a picture before the first bite.
- ✍🏻 Write to empty my brain and (hopefully) inspire others.
- 📖 Grab a book but struggle to finish it.
- 😆 Find new hobbies to obsess over, then discard shortly after.
