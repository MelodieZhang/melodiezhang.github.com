Hi, I'm Menghan Zhang, a master student studying [Integrated Innovation for Products & Services](https://www.cmu.edu/iii/degrees/miips/) at Carnegie Mellon University. Previously I worked as a full-time Product Designers at [Zhihu](zhihu.com) for 2 years. Before that, I got my bachelor and master of Software Engineering in Wuhan University.

From my academic and professional experience, I learned that innovative solutions hit the sweet spot where viability, desirability and feasibility overlap. I also believe that design is to solve problems creatively.

When I'm not designing, I like to:
- 🍱 Make bento and snap a picture before the first bite.
- ✍🏻 Write to empty my brain and (hopefully) inspire others.
- 📖 Grab a book but struggle to finish it.
- 😆 Find new hobbies to obsess over, then discard shortly after.
