Hi, I'm Menghan Zhang, a multi-disciplinary product designer passionate about creating amazing experiences for people. Currently I am designing Chrome OS at Google. Previously I interned at Google Play and worked as full-time Product Designer at Zhihu.

When I'm not designing, I like to:

- 📖 Grab multiple books while struggle to finish them.
- 🎶 Play chords on guitar for a musical therapy.
- ✍🏻 Write to empty my brain and hopefully inspire others.
- 🍱 Try new recipes and snap a picture before the first bite.
- 😆 Find new hobbies to obsess over, then discard shortly after.
