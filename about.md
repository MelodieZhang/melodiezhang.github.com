Hi, I'm Menghan Zhang, a multi-disciplinary product designer passionate about solving problems for people. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University and Wuhan University. Previously I interned at Google and worked as full-time Product Designer at Zhihu.

When I'm not designing, I like to:
- ✍🏻 Write to empty my brain and hopefully inspire others.
- 📖 Grab a book while struggle to finish it.
- 🍱 Try new recipes and snap a picture before the first bite.
- 😆 Find new hobbies to obsess over, then discard shortly after.
