# Fun Stuff / Side Projects
I doodle, write, and code.

## I Doodle

Illustration allows me to blend the real world with the metaphorical. I use Photoshop and Procreate to doodle whatever in my mind. Check more of my illustrations on **[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/menghan.jpg/)**.

## I Write

I'm a believer of "write to think". I like to share my learning and thinking along the way. I write on **[Medium](https://medium.com/@melodiezhang)** and **[Zhihu](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/melodie)**.


## I Code

2 years ago, I taught myself Swift for iOS platform development and made a simple **[weather app](https://github.com/MelodieZhang/Swift-weather)**. Should designers code? Why not! ðŸ˜†
