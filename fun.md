# Fun Stuff
What I do when I'm not designing?

## I Doodle
Illustration allows me to blend the real world with the metaphorical.

## I Write
There are many ways to learn. Design is one, writing is another.

## I Code
Coding is another form of design and creation. Two years ago, I taught myself Swift for iOS platform development and made a simple weather app. Should designers code? Why not!
