#####Operating Systems
I use Linux for development on my personal computer.
I have used Windows for development during two internships at Microsoft, India.

#####Java 	
I have taken a programming course based on Java at college, which involved building advanced applications that used multi-threading, design patterns, UI and other concepts.
I have also used Java for competitive programming.	
	
#####JavaScript 
I have used JavaScript extensively in the context of front-end web development at three web-development startup stints. I also have some experience with back-end JavaScript (node.js). 	
	
	
#####Android development with the Java SDK 	
Recently began exploring the SDK in order to develop an image processing application using OpenCv for Android. Prototype details [here](http://mewscope.appspot.com/).
	
	
#####Git/Github 	
I have used git locally for version control on several projects and I'm very familiar with the work flow. I recently began pushing code to [GitHub](https://github.com/shrutirij).
	
	
#####Automated testing (JUnit, phantomJS)
No experience. Beginning preliminary reading.
	
	
#####JavaDoc
No experience. 	
	
	
#####Google Web Toolkit
Built a simple GWT application using a getting-started tutorial in order to understand how control flow works. Looking to dive into the source code.	
	
	
#####Google App Engine
I have built several apps with the App Engine SDK, primarily with a python back-end and HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript front-end.

TinyWebDB built for challenge 1 (non-trivial app) and hosted on App Engine [[here]](). Code [[here]](https://github.com/shrutirij/testdbtiny).
	
#####Blockly 
Built the source quite recently and exploring different classes for blocks, using the playground for experimentation.	
	
	
#####Google Closure library and compiler
Little experience - I've followed getting started tutorials and I'm working to build my first Closure app soon.
