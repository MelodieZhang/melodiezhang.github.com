I co-founded the Computer Programming Special Interest Group at my college and conducted several interactive sessions (attended by an average of 300 students) on basic and complex algorithmic concepts for students (irrespective of major) looking to begin programming. We had a few programming competitions, as well. Our group also conducted short, intensive programming camps for over 400 students at two other colleges in India.
