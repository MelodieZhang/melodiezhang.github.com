An ideal educational setting would be where anyone could learn anything, without restriction. I am inspired by Jeannette Wing's thoughts on universal [Computational Thinking](http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/366/1881/3717.short). App Inventor has the potential to make application programming skills accessible to the world. Serving this vision would involve developing technology that makes programming lucid and appealing to all. It would be an incredible project to work for, in order to kickstart my involvement in the world of open source.
