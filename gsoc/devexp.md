#####Teams

I have worked in small teams for several class projects. One of the largest projects undertaken as coursework was to build a compiler from scratch - the compiler was built for a toy language and every line of code was to be written by the team. The class did not allow us to use tools like Lex or other generators for parsers. This was an enormous challenge and teamwork was key.

I have worked in an industrial software development team as an intern at the Microsoft India Development Center. The team worked primarily on optimizing revenue from Bing Ads. My project was part of a much larger Ad-relevance machine and involved working with several senior researchers and developers on the team. It was my first exposure to using massive cloud architecture.

In the startup sphere, I have been an intern with two web development startups and the lead web developer in a student startup. The startups I've worked with had small, tight-knit teams and excellent intra-team communication. Work flow was generally smooth in all aspects. I obtained large exposure to web design and development during these stints. 

I am currently doing my undergraduate thesis at Microsoft Research, working with the Advanced Development Group. The group focuses on developing scalable systems based on research done in the lab. I have the opportunity of working with senior research developers and researchers themselves. I am currently attempting to build an improved search system for Bing Maps. This involves communicating with researchers in Microsoft Research, Redmond while I am in the India office - coordination and understanding between team members on the project is proving to be essential.

#####Large Code Bases

I have explored the codebase of PostgreSQL and have implemented various page replacement mechanisms as part of a class project.

I am currently working through a large codebase developed by researchers at Microsoft Research. The application is primarily used for fuzzy searching. The codebase has very little documentation (as it is internal to the company) and has been a challenge to work through. It has given me immense understanding of how to read another programmer's code.

I have also begun working on [MEC](https://www.mecr.org/), exploring a huge codebase in ASP .NET MVC and the Razor framework, in order to add new features.

#####Online Dev

I am completely new to the world of open source and my experience is limited to lurking on IRC channels and following mailing lists (MuseScore, AirMozilla recently).

I have also contributed a feature to [pixyll](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll).
