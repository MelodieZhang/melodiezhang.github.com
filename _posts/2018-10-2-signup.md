summary: How to increase conversion on mobile platforms
---

## Overview
Sign in and sign up are one of the most common and fundamental things in product design. However, they are also one of the thickest parts to design. In 2017, I led the design of mobile sign up and sign in experience at Zhihu, and successfully reduced confusion and friction in the flow.

## My Role
I owned the project and was responsible for all the design for iOS and Android sign up & sign in experience.

## Where is the Friction

I did a comprehensive experience audit of Zhihuâ€™s mobile sign up and sign in experience flow. I also observed how people interacted with the existing interfaces, from which I identified the friction and opportunities throughout the entire journey.

## Learning from other apps
Before jumping into designing, I analyzed how other apps designed their sign up and sign in experience.

Findings:
- Multi-step sign up is applied well to Mobile scenario. People can focus on one task at a time and the experience is more smooth.
- Using multi-step sign up method can increase conversion rate, because people feel less overwhelmed when the design guides them through the process.

## Design Decisions
Informed by the findings in competitive analysis phase, we ran a fast A/B test to validate our assumptions. The result indicated that registration in one step with multiple forms did suffer higher bounce rate compared to registration in multiple steps. Thus we decided to break down sign-up into three steps.

### Less Click times
Previously, there were 5 clicks away to sign up. Now it only need 2 clicks throughout the process. The multi-step design is more efficient even though the procedures seem longer. People spend less time finishing signing up.

### Unified Structure
I used the Complexion Reduction design language to focus on the key task of each step. By following a shared structure, pages throughout this flow are consistent and clear.

### Be Mindful of Visibility
During user testing I realized a detail. The original sign in button was placed on the bottom of the page, but since the keyboard was displayed by default when user entered this page, the button was invisible. In next iteration, I moved the sign in button to the top right corner to make every important elements visible.

### Consider Every Possible Situation

## Results: How Did it Work
Our main metric is the overall conversion rate between opening the page and signing up / signing in successfully. After we launch the new design with A/B test, we found that the sign up conversion rate increased by 8%, and the sign in conversion increased by 32%. Also, people gave us lots of positive feedback for better experience.

## Reflections
My role in this project was expanded from a product designer to a project owner. I need to not only ship the design, but also coordinate resources and be responsible for the progress.

Being an owner means one should have a clear understanding of what problems the project or the team is facing, and find out a way to remove the roadblock to best push the project forward.
