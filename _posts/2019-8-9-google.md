summary: Worked as a UX design intern on Google Play team
---

This summer I worked as a UX design intern at Google on Google Play team. During the 12 weeks, I worked closely with PMs, designers, researchers, and engineers to design for the best digital purchase experience for Google Play.
* I designed a new concept to encourage purchase, worked with researchers to validate the concept, iterated on the design, and collaborated with a partner team to ship the MVP.
* Redesigned the Google Play promotion to create the consistency across different channels, both for MVP and a long-term version with a more delightful experience.
* Established a scalable framework with principles to simplify the purchase experience, and facilitated a better collaboration between Play Platform and other teams in Google Play.

Due to NDA, I am unable to disclose any details about the projects. Instead, I will be sharing the key lessons I've learned from this awesome experience. Stay tuned :)
