# The Prompt
> A new school year is approaching. Design an experience for **new students** to **browse, search, and propose** new student organizations.

### Initial Thoughts
Joining student organizations is one of the most exciting things when new student steps into university, and it has many benefits like making new friends and developing soft skills. As a student, I had some personal experience joining student orgs in the past, so I started off with thinking about what I know and what I don't know about this topic.

#### So, here are what I wanted to know:
- **Why** do new students need to search student organizations?
- **Who** are the stakeholders except for new students?
- **How** do new students join student organizations?
- **What** is students' current experience to browse, search or propose new orgs?
- **What** is the process of proposing new organizations?
- **When** and **where** would new students need this experience?

### Assumptions & Constraints:
- I took Carnegie Mellon University as a reference for this exercise. I assumed different universities have similar experience and form of student organizations.
- To narrow down the problem scope, I considered three key stakeholders throughout the process: **New students, organization officers, and the student government** which is responsible for reviewing and recognizing student organizations. Due to the scope of the prompt, I mainly focus on the new students user groups. However, for future development, the needs of other stakeholders should also be taken into consideration.

# Understand the Problem
### Interview & Secondary Research
I interviewed with 6 students who had the experience of attending or managing student organizations. I also did a role play as a new student to experience searching and proposing new student organizations with the available information online.

#### What I learned from research:

- The motivations of students joining orgs varies: Out of interest, just for fun, discover new opportunities, boost resume, make a difference, etc.
- The meaning of “join” is vague. It means joining in a chat group, taking part in group activities, or adding to their mailing list.
- It’s important to meet real people before making a commitment.
- Most students rely on activities fair and friends’ recommendations heavily to get information.
- Offline solutions take too much time, and online solutions have very limited information.
- The mental load of applying and starting a new org is so high that students may be discouraged.

### Personas
After identifying the problems and get a better understanding of the context, I built two primary personas based on the insights I gathered from the research. The personas helped me develop a clear picture of who I am designing for in this design exercise.

### Journey Maps
In order to empathize with the pain points students have when searching and proposing orgs, I walked through the current journey maps of both two personas. Also I realized **finding organizations is a much higher frequency action** for new students compared to proposing a new organization, which is an important point that has guided my design in the following steps.

# Ideation
### Explore and Prioritize Ideas
I came up with four ideas to help new students find organizations. Then I placed them on an **impact/effort matrix** to prioritize and evaluate these ideas. After asking for feedback and comparing the implementation effort and the potential value for students, I decided to use the form of **concept A** and combine the Activities Fair guidance concept of C to improve the offline experience as well.

### Storyboard
I sketched a storyboard to visualize the journey of a new students finding and joining organizations with the app. Based on the storyboard, I listed tasks the user needs to be able to complete to use the product successfully.

# Design
### Structure Exploration
Then I started by sketching out to explore what the app might look like in order to meet students' needs. I brainstormed and iterated on the structure of each feature that I extracted from storyboard.

### Wireframes

### High Fidelity prototypes
Since the target users are students, I used vibrant color and bold aesthetic to reflect the excitement and  of finding and joining a new organization. It’s UI contains unfilled shapes that invite the user to populate them with new content and courses. It’s copywriting speaks with an inviting, can-do tone of voice.

## How to Measure Success?
As a final step, before shipping this experience, I would define the key metrics that can help evaluate the solution.
- **Favorite button click rate & organization join rate**: How useful is the favorite feature to help students find interested organizations?
- **Application completion time**: How long does it take to finish the application?
- **Application submission success rate**: How many students finish the submission process?
- **Net Promoter Score**: Student satisfaction about the solution.

## Next Steps
Because of time limit, many of my design decisions in this exercise were made based on some **casual interviews and assumptions**, so the concept and design still need to be iterated based on further user testing and feedback. If time allows, I would conduct **more structured user research and user testing** to understand these questions:
- What kinds of filters would students need except for categories?
- Are the wireframe flow and interfaces intuitive for new students?
- Do new students find the activities fair map useful?
- Which modules on org page are useful for students and which are not?
- Is the application easy to complete?
- Do I need to design an experience to help students track the progress of applications?

After getting more solid insights and feedback from the field, I would do more iterations to polish the solution and interface design.
