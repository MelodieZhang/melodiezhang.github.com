summary: Cross-platform design from ideation to launch
---
## Background

In five years since 2011, Zhihu transformed from a small question & answer product to the largest knowledge sharing platform in China. With the hyper-growth of the company, the usability of the web product was challenged It was time for a redesign, both for ourselves and our users. In 2016, we decided to redesign our web product starting from the User Profile.

## My Role
I designed the new Profile for web between Jul 2016 and Jan 2017, and collaborated with 3 designers on the building of new web design system. After that, I designed Profile design for Android and iOS independently.

## Define Problems and Goals

### Find Out Key Problems from Context

To get insights, I partnered with the colleague in user operation team and reviewed a bunch of feedback on Profile experience. Also, I gathered valuable feedback from internal stakeholders as PMs and designers. Here are the insights from this process.

After listening to voices from different perspectives, I found a big match between user problems and stakeholder concerns.

### Deeper Insights From Data

Besides collecting inputs from people, I also looked at data to get a more objective perspective about the Profile, which revealed many valuable insights into how people use Profile under current design, and demonstrated some of my assumptions like **people value content quality** and desired to know more about a person by exploring his or her generated content.

### Define Design Goals

By learning from people and digging into the data, I could see a relatively more comprehensive picture of the Profile, which helped us to reframe the problem:

>**How might we help people better present themselves and know about other people to build connections?**

Goals & Measurements:
- People are more willing to visit Profile than they were before.
- People find the experience of knowing about a person easy and pleasant.
- People build more connections with each other.

Based on our objectives, I defined four key words as a north star of the redesign:

## Explore, Design and Iterate

### Start with Information Structure

Information structure is like the skeleton of interface. To find out what the best way was to present a person, I firstly broke existing Profile down into 5 main modules.

My next challenge was how to re-organize these bones to compose a skeleton that works. I did a variety of explorations with different combinations and layouts. Also I co-created with and getting feedback from inside stakeholders, from which I found an interesting point‚Äî

>**People tend to compare the experience of visiting other's Profile to the experience of meeting a person in the real world.**

In the real world, people often first meet each other by "seeing the face", then "making a brief introduction", and then talking about details like "what I do" or "what I have achieved".

### Initial Iterations Focused on Clarity

Inspired by the insights from wireframe phase, I started to do some  experimentations with **higher fidelity prototypes** to get a more tangible feeling about each possibility. I focused on improving the clarity of existing content:

- Help people know about a person in a smooth and natural viewing flow by **rearranging modules and improving visual hierarchy**.
- Make core content stand out by **adjusting contrast** between cards and background.
- Improve legibility by **increasing type size** and contrast.
- Make it easier for people to read answers by **changing the order of content tab**.
- Reduce complexity in navigation by **defining a more intuitive logical relationship** between pages.


### Getting Feedback

In order to validate my explorations, I printed these prototypes and put them on the passage wall of the office where people could stop by and take a look. We created a Slack channel and collected lots of feedback from "inside users". Here's what I learned:

- The new design was clean and clear, but it seemed a relatively conservative solution.
- Even though using 3 columns to layout could display more with the same space, people felt overwhelmed and the efficiency of viewing content, on the contrary, was reduced.

### Design Decisions to Make Profile More "Human"

How could I add magic to the Profile to make it more attractive? I applied **cover photos**, which help set the tone and involve people in the design of their own profiles.

In this phase, another major change I made was the layout. I used **2 columns layout** to create clearer structure. It was more consistent with other pages. Also, I tweaked some small UI elements like moving the name on top of the cover photo to the bottom of it since the previous solution caused legibility concerns.

Result: People felt less overwhelmed. The 2-column solution provided better visual priority and browsing flow. The addition of cover photos lighted the entire page. Now the Profile was much more "human" and attractive.



### Take a Step Further on Efficiency

One of our goal was to make the experience more efficient. I made interactive prototypes to test my idea about the content navigation tab, which was the key to improve efficiency. Here are my iterating process:

1. **The navigation tabs would stick to the top header when user scrolls the page.** The problem was two bars sticking on the top of page took up too much space thus it was not friendly for users with smaller viewpoint screens.
2. **How about we push the header out of the view when user scrolls down and bring it back when user scrolls up?** By testing with prototype, I found that the movement felt bulky and disturbing.
3. **How about we combine the header and navigation tabs?** Yes it worked! The final solution hit a great balance between efficiency and volume. The experience was more smooth and responsive.

## Web Profile Final Design

We refreshed the user interface with a clearer and more efficient design that helps people's content shine. When the core page redesign was taking shape, I also worked on sub-modules related to Profile, including content list under each tab and the experience of editing Profile.

## Design for Mobile App
When designing for mobile devices, the major challenge I was facing was how to adapt the information on web to mobile devices and create a consistent cross-platform experience at the same time.

### Explore and Narrow down
I sketched on paper and made hi-fi prototypes to test the design, and kept iterating until it meet our design goals.

## The Impact

### Web
After our 5 months' effort, the new web Profile firstly rolled out to a small group of users and then it was gradually pushed out to all users in Dec 2016. Here are the key results:

### App
The redesign of Profile on Android was released in Sep 2017, and the iOS version was released in Feb 2018. For Android, here are the core data results:

## What I learned
Design is a never ending process. Along the way, I came across lots of frustrating moments when I couldn't figure out how to take my design to the next level, yet after trial and error I pushed myself and finally found a better solution. Even launch is only a start, we were continuing to learn, iterate and improve upon it.

Also, I reflected on the entire project and thought about where I could do better:
- üîç Validate idea as early as possible with real users.
- üïπ Use better opt-in strategy for web.
- üìê Define more comprehensive measurements for the goals.
