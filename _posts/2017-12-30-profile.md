summary: Cross-Platform Experience Design From Conception to Launch
---

## Background

In just five years since 2011, Zhihu transformed from a small question & answer product to the largest knowledge sharing platform in China. By 2016, Zhihu had over 50 million users sharing their knowledge and experience. However, with the hyper-growth of the company, the usability of the core product was challenged. In 2016, we decided to redesign our web product starting from the User Profile to make the cross-platform experience more consistent, reliable and delightful.

## My Role
I led the full redesign of web Profile between Jul 2016 and Jan 2017, and also collaborated with 3 other designers on the new web design system. The new web Profile rolled out on Dec 2016. After that, I was responsible for all the design of app Profile independently from conception to launch.

## A Massive Redesign Project. How Should We Start?

### Find Out Key Problems from Context

To get insights, I partnered with the colleague in user operation team and reviewed a bunch of feedback on Profile experience. Also, I gathered valuable feedback from internal stakeholders as PMs and designers. Here are the insights from this process.

After listening to voices from different perspectives, I found a big match between user problems and stakeholder concerns.

### Deeper Insights From Data

Besides collecting inputs from people, I also looked at data to get a more objective perspective about the Profile, which revealed many valuable insights into how people use Profile under current design, and demonstrated some of my assumptions like people value content quality and desired to know more about a person by exploring his or her generated content.

### Define Design Goals

By learning from people and digging into the data, I could see a relatively more comprehensive picture of the Profile, which helped us to reframe the problem:

>**How might we help people better present themselves and know about other people to build connections?**

Goals & Measurements:
- People are more willing to visit Profile than they were before.
- People find the experience of knowing about a person easy and pleasant.
- People build more connections with each other.

Based on our objectives, I defined four key words as a north star of the redesign:

## How can we redesign it to achieve the goal?

### Start with Information Structure

Information structure is like the skeleton of interface. To find out what the best way was to present a person, I firstly broke existing Profile down into 5 main modules.

My next challenge was how to re-organize these bones to compose a skeleton that works. I did a variety of explorations with different combinations and layouts. Also I co-created with and getting feedback from inside stakeholders, from which I found an interesting point‚Äî

>**People tend to compare the experience of visiting other's Profile to the experience of meeting a person in the real world.**

In the real world, people often first meet each other by "seeing the face", then "making a brief introduction", and then talking about details like "what I do" or "what I have achieved".

### Initial Iterations Focused on Clarity

Inspired by the insights from wireframe phase, I started to do some  experimentations with higher fidelity prototypes to get a more tangible feeling about each possibility. I focused on improving the clarity of existing content:
- Help people know about a person in a smooth and natural viewing flow by rearranging modules and improving visual hierarchy.
- Make core content stand out by adjusting contrast between cards and background.
- Improve legibility by increasing type size and contrast.
- Make it easier for people to read answers by changing the order of content tab.
- Reduce complexity in navigation by defining a more intuitive logical relationship between pages.

### Getting Feedback

In order to validate my explorations, I printed these prototypes and put them on the passage wall of the office where people could stop by and take a look. We created a Slack channel and collected lots of feedback from "inside users". Here's what I learned:

- The new design was clean and clear, but it seemed a relatively conservative solution.
- Even though using 3 columns to layout could display more with the same space, people felt overwhelmed and the efficiency of viewing content, on the contrary, was reduced.

### Design Decisions to Make Profile More "Human"

How could I add magic to the Profile to make it more attractive? I applied cover photos, which had the following benefits:
- Cover photos help set the tone for a person's Profile page. People like to read pictures rather than text. If we compare Profile to a person, the first impression could be enhanced by the visual clue given by cover photos.
- For people who aims at building personal brand on Zhihu, they could make good use of cover photos to enhance their professional image.
- People could involve in the design process by customizing their Profile pages. The efforts that they put into it could instill feelings of competence in the user. (IKEA Effect).

In this phase, another major change I made was the layout. I used 2 columns layout to create clearer structure. It was more consistent with other pages. Also, I tweaked some small UI elements like moving the name on top of the cover photo to the bottom of it since the previous solution caused legibility concerns.

Result: People felt less overwhelmed. The 2-column solution provided better visual priority and browsing flow. The addition of cover photos lighted the entire page. Now the Profile was much more "human" and attractive.

### Take a Step Further on Efficiency

One of our goal was to make the experience more efficient. I made interactive prototypes to test my idea about the content navigation tab, which was the key to improve efficiency. Here are my iterating process:

1. **The navigation tabs would stick to the top header when user scrolls the page.** The problem was two bars sticking on the top of page took up too much space thus it was not friendly for users with smaller viewpoint screens.
2. **How about we push the header out of the view when user scrolls down and bring it back when user scrolls up?** By testing with prototype, I found that the movement felt bulky and disturbing.
3. **How about we combine the header and navigation tabs?** Yes it worked! The final solution hit a great balance between efficiency and volume. The experience was more smooth and responsive.

## Final Design for Web Profile

We refreshed the user interface with a clearer and more efficient design that helps people's content shine. When the core page redesign was taking shape, I also worked on sub-modules related to Profile, including content list under each tab and the experience of editing Profile.

## One More Challenge: Designing for Mobile App
When designing for mobile devices, the major challenge I was facing was how to adapt the information on web to mobile devices and create a consistent cross-platform experience at the same time.

### Explore and Narrow down
I sketched on paper and made hi-fi prototypes to test the design, and kept iterating until it meet our design goals.

### Final Design for Mobile Profile

## The Impact

### Web
After our 5 months' effort, the new web Profile firstly rolled out to a small group of users and then it was gradually pushed out to all users in Dec 2016. The major impacts are:
- People build more connections with each other in new design. **The following rate of Profile increased by 28%.**
- **The opening rate of content increased by 35%**, which means people are more willing to know more about a person.
- **The traffic of Profile page was increased significantly.** People visit the Profile more times than they did before, while I guess part of the reasons might be the fresh design, so we need to keep tracking the data in the long term to validate the point.
- Also, We **setup a unified style guide and UI components** for web platform.

### App
The redesign of Profile on Android was released in Sep 2017, and the iOS version was released in Feb 2018. For Android, here are the core data results:
- **The following rate of Profile increased by 312%.**
- **The opening rate of content increased by 71%.**
- **The average visits per capita increased by 19%.**

## What I learned
Design is a never ending process. Along the way, I came across lots of frustrating moments when I couldn't figure out how to take my design to the next level, yet after trial and error I pushed myself and finally found a better solution. Even launch is only a start, we were continuing to learn, iterate and improve upon it.

Also, I reflected on the entire project and listed What I could do better:
- üîç Validate idea as early as possible with real users.
- üïπ Use better opt-in strategy for web.
- üìê Define more comprehensive measurements for the goals.
