summary: Design for millions
---

In just six years since 2010, Zhihu transformed from a small ask & answer platform to a large knowledge community. By 2016, Zhihu had over 50 million users sharing their knowledge and experience. However, with the hyper-growth of the company, the usability of the core product was challenged. In 2016, we decided to redesign our web product starting from the Profile page to make the cross-platform experience more consistent, reliable and delightful.

## My Role
I led the redesign of web Profile between July 2016 and January 2017 and collaborated with three other designers on the new web design system. The new web Profile rolled out on December 2016. After that, I was also responsible for the end-to-end design of app Profile independently.

## What are the Problems?
To get insights, I partnered with user operation team and reviewed a bunch of feedback on experience and needs around Profile module. Also, I gathered valuable feedback from internal stakeholders as PMs and designers. In current design, these problems stood out.
- **Cluttered information layout**
- **Lack of attraction**
- **Inefficient interaction**
- **Inconsistent cross-platform experience**

## How to Measure Success
Our goal for the redesign was to help people know about other people more efficiently. We translated the core goal into four key words as the north star of our design:
- **Clarity**
- **Efficiency**
- **Attraction**
- **Consistency**

How did we evaluate whether the redesign succeed or failed? I used the HEART framework to define our metrics. Two of the most important metrics are the following rate and open rate of content.

## Understand the Context

## Concepts Diverge
To find the best way to organize the information, I explored many possiblities and tested the concepts with users for feedback.

## Design Iterations
### Iteration 1: Use Card to Increase Contrast
I prototyped new profile page according to the result in  wireframe phrase. We applied cards to organize and display content composed of different elements.

### Iteration 2: Make it Unique and Attractive for everyone
Through Guerrilla user research, we found that the first prototype was not attractive enough, it only displayed contents. To make it more personal, we adopted cover image.

### Iteration 3: Adjust with User Feedback
When testing prototype with 10% users,  we found the full bleed top area makes it hardly possible for users to find a proper image. I adjusted the ratio to improve the situation.

## Cross-Platform experience
When designing for mobile devices, we faced many challenges. How could we adapt the UI elements to mobile devices and create a seamless cross-platform experience at the same time? I created lots of prototypes to test every possibility and invited my co-workers to test and seek for feedback.

## Introducing Final Design

## The Impact
Since A/B testing with 50% users, the following rate on web profile page has increased by 28%, and people has been more willing to open and read page contents.

## Reflection
A big redesign is daunting. There are many variables and unknowns that tell you there will be potential failure down the road, but the end result is well worth the effort. Launch is a start. We're continuing to learn, iterate and improve upon it.
