title: Redesigning Zhihu Profile for Millions
feature-img: "/imgs/profile/cover2.jpg"
summary: Cross-platform design from ideation to launch
---
## Background
In five years since 2011, Zhihu transformed from a small question & answer product to the largest knowledge sharing platform in China. However, with the hyper-growth of the company, the usability of the web product was challenged. It was time for a redesign, both for ourselves and for our users. In 2016, we decided to redesign our web product starting from the User Profile.

## My Role
- Redesigned the entire experience of Profile for web between Jul and Dec 2016
- Built the foundation of a new web Design System with 3 designers.
- Designed the entire experience of Profile for Android and iOS in 2017.
- Worked with engineers to translate the pixels I drew into real-life experience.

## A Big Project. How Should We Start?

### Understanding Problems & Concerns

I started off by **gathering information**. I talked to people who've worked on the product from the very beginning, colleagues in user operation team, product managers from different feature teams, other product designers, and users. because before I could figure out how to improve the experience of Profile (or even the entire Zhihu website), I needed to understand the problems, expectations and concerns people had about it. Also, it was an important phase for the team to align on **why we needed a redesign**.

Hearing voices from different perspectives offered me more insights to understand our **users and internal stakeholders**. I narrowed down and mapped out the **affinity diagram** to organize these problems and expectations into groups, by which I learned which aspects I should focus on for this redesign.

### Deeper Insights From Data

Besides collecting inputs from people, I also looked at data to get a better understanding about the Profile, which revealed many valuable insights into how people use Profile under current design, and demonstrated some of our assumptions like **people value content quality** and **people expect to know more about a person by exploring his or her generated content**.

### Defining Design Goals

After understanding the problems and context, our goal of redesign began to take shape.

>**How might we help people better present themselves and know about other people to build connections?**

#### Goals & Measurements:
- üéØ People are more willing to visit Profile than they were before.
- üéØ People find the experience of knowing about a person easy and pleasant.
- üéØ People build more connections with each other.

I defined four key words as the north star of the redesign based on our objectives:

## Iterative Design Process

### Exploring Information Structure

Information structure is like the skeleton of interface. To find out what the best way was to present a person, I firstly **broke existing Profile down into 5 major  modules**.
![image](/imgs/profile/modules.jpg)

My next challenge was **how to re-organize these bones to compose a skeleton that works**. I did a variety of explorations with different combinations and layouts. Also I co-created with and getting feedback from internal stakeholders, from which I found an interesting point‚Äî

>**People tend to compare the experience of visiting other's Profile to the experience of meeting a person in the real world.**

In the real world, people often first meet each other by "seeing the face", then "making a brief introduction", and then talking about details like "what I do" or "what I have achieved".

### Initial Iterations Focusing on Clarity

Inspired by the insights from the wireframe phase, I started to do experiments with **higher fidelity prototypes** to get a more tangible feeling about each possibility. I mainly focused on improving the **clarity** of existing content:

#### My key design decisions in this phase:
- Help people know about a person in a smooth and natural viewing flow by **rearranging modules and improving visual hierarchy**.
- Make core content stand out by **adjusting contrast** between cards and background.
- Improve legibility by **increasing type size** and contrast.
- Make it easier for people to read answers by **changing the order of content tab**.
- Reduce complexity in navigation by **defining a unified logical relationship** between pages.
- Increase efficiency by **reducing the hierarchy of pages**.


### Getting Feedback

In order to validate my design concept, I printed these prototypes and put them on the wall of the office where people could stop by and take a look. We created a Slack channel and received lots of feedback from internal users.

From these feedback, I was able to see what worked and **what didn't work out** with my first trial:
- Even though using 3 columns to layout could display more with the same space, people felt overwhelmed and the efficiency of viewing content, on the contrary, was reduced.
- The top profile info summary card might not effective enough to express the uniqueness of a person.
- We should value community achievements over the number of followers.
- The order of the navigation tab was not aligned with people's mental model.

### Design Decisions to Make Profile More "Human"
For the second round of iteration, I applied **cover photos** to help set the tone and involve people in the design of their own profiles. On this stage, another major change I made was the layout. I used **2 columns layout** to create clearer structure. It was more consistent with other pages. Also, I tweaked some small UI elements like moving the name on top of the cover photo to the bottom of it since the previous solution caused legibility concerns.

Result: Users felt less overwhelmed. The 2-column solution provided better visual priority and browsing flow. The addition of cover photos lighted the entire page. Now the Profile was much more "human" and attractive.

### Take a Step Further on Efficiency

One of our goal was to make the experience more efficient. I made interactive prototypes to test my idea about the content navigation tab, which was the key to improve efficiency. Here are my iterating process:

1. **The navigation tabs would stick to the top header when user scrolls the page.** The problem was two bars sticking on the top of page took up too much space thus it was not friendly for users with smaller viewpoint screens.

2. **How about we push the header out of the view when user scrolls down and bring it back when user scrolls up?** However, by testing with prototype, I found that the movement felt bulky and disturbing.

3. **How about we combine the header and navigation tabs?** Yes it worked! The final solution hit a balance between efficiency and volume. The experience was more smooth and responsive.

## Web Profile Final Design

We refreshed the user interface with a clearer and more efficient design that helps people's content shine. When the core page redesign was taking shape, I also worked on sub-modules related to Profile, including content list under each tab and the experience of editing Profile.

## Designing for Mobile App
When designing for mobile devices, the major challenge I was facing was how to adapt the information on web to mobile devices and create a consistent cross-platform experience at the same time.

### Iterating and Narrow down
I sketched on paper and made hi-fi prototypes to test the design, and kept iterating until it meet our design goals.

## The Impact

### Web
After our 5 months' effort, we launched the redesigned web Profile to a small set of users in November 2016. During this time, we kept track of user feedback and made adjustments accordingly. After demonstrating the redesign didn't have negative impact on metrics, we gradually rolled the redesign out to everyone.

At the same time, I partnered with 3 designers to build the foundation of Zhihu Web 2.0 Design System. We kept evolving the style guides and components to guide the redesign of the other pages and modules on web product.

Key results of web Profile redesign:

### App
The redesign of Profile on Android was launched in Sep 2017, and the iOS version was launched in Feb 2018. For Android, here are the key results:

## What I learned
Design is a never ending process. Along the way, I came across lots of frustrating moments when I couldn't figure out how to take my design to the next level, yet after trial and error I pushed myself and finally found a better solution. Even launch is only a start, we were continuing to learn, iterate and improve upon it.

Also, I reflected on the entire project and thought about where I could do better:
- üîç Validate idea as early as possible with external users.
- üïπ Use better opt-in strategy for web.
- üìê Define more comprehensive measurements for the goals.
