title: Redesigning Zhihu Profile for Millions
feature-img: "/imgs/profile/cover3.jpg"
summary: Cross-platform design from ideation to launch
---
## Background
[Zhihu](https://zhihu.com) is a Chinese question-and-answer platform (like Quora). It was launched in 2011 and now has over 200 million users. In 2016, we found **the experience of the website was challenged due to the hyper-growth of the business**. We had accumulated lots of design debt. We heard from users that they had difficulty using the product. It was also difficult for the team to know where to put new features because the interfaces didn't have a clear information hierarchy. Thus we decided to **redesign the experience of the web product**, starting from user profile.

## My Role
- Redesigned the entire experience of Profile for web between Jul and Dec 2016
- Collaborated with 3 other designers to work on the new web design system.
- Designed the entire experience of Profile for Android and iOS in 2017.

## The Goal of Profile

### Current state vs. Goal state
I did a **competitive analysis** of how other products approach profile module and mapped them to a 2x2 matrix. After discussing with the team, we found out our current state and goal state.

## Identifying Problems
### Usability testing & Quantitative Data
I conducted usability testing with some of our internal users to learn more about **what problems they had in using the current Profile**.  Also I collected data to get a better understanding about **how people were using Profile in general**. When I combined results from usability testing and quantitative data, I found out **the problems I should focus on** for the redesign.

### Card Sorting
I also did card sorting with 6 users to learn **how people understood the existing information** on Profile. After that, I asked users to **prioritize** what information mattered to them most when they looked at another user's profile.

Then I developed a diagram to organize what I learned from the card sorting. I learned **what information users care about** and **why the existing design didn‚Äôt meet users‚Äô expectations**. The findings also helped me move forward to the exploration of our information structure.

## Design Process
### Exploring Information Structure

First, I divided the information on Profile to **5 main modules** based on the results from card sorting. After that I organized these modules to explore possible layouts based on the priority of which modules mattered the most for people to make follow decisions.

### Initial Try

According to the insights and assumptions from the discussion in wireframe phase, I came up with the first iteration. My key design decisions in this phase:
- Used **3-column** structure to organize the information.
- Gathered all the **achievements** together.
- Redesigned the order of the **content tabs**.

### Getting Feedback

In order to test my design concept, I printed these prototypes and put them on the wall of the office where people could stop by and take a look. We created a Slack channel and received lots of feedback from internal users. Two of the major feedback I got from this phase:

- The order of the content tabs **didn't match people's mental model**.
- **Conflicting feedback on 3-column structure** from PMs and users.

### Iterations Based on Feedback

To address the conflict, I took a step back to check my assumptions in wireframe phase, and designed **higher fidelity prototypes** to help people get a more tangible feeling about each possibility. After lots of discussion on the pros and cons of each layout, we all agreed that **Solution E** struck a good balance between clarity and efficiency.

#### Here are some of the major design changes I made throughout the iterative process:
- Used **2-column layout** instead of 3-column to create clearer visual priority and browsing flow. It's also more consistent with other pages.
- **Adjusted the order of the navigation tab** to match people's mental model.
- **Reduce unnecessary visual elements** to make people focus on the content itself.

### Adding Social Elements to Achieve the Goal State
To add more human elements to the interface, I used **cover photo** and **highlighted the potential connections** between users.

### A Step Further on Efficiency
One of our goal was to make the experience more efficient. I made **interactive prototypes** to test my idea on the content navigation, which was the key to improve efficiency of browsing. Here are my iterations:

- **Iteration 1**: The navigation tabs would stick to the top header when user scrolls the page. The problem was that two bars sticking on the top of page took up too much space thus it was not friendly for users with smaller viewpoint screens.

- **Iteration 2**: How about we push the header out of the view when user scrolls down and bring it back when user scrolls up? However, by testing with prototype, I found that the movement felt bulky and disturbing.

- **Iteration 3**: How about we combine the header and navigation tabs? Yes it worked! The final solution hit a balance between efficiency and volumn. The experience was more smooth and responsive.

## Web Profile Final Design

We refreshed the user interface with a clearer and more efficient design that **helps people's content shine**.

At the same time, I worked on **sub-modules** related to Profile, including content layout under each tab and the experience of viewing and editing Profile. Also, I partnered with 3 designers to build the foundation of **Zhihu Web 2.0 Design System**. We kept evolving the style guides and components to guide the redesign of the other pages and modules on web product.

## The Impact (Web)

After our 5 months' design and development, we launched the redesigned web Profile to a small set of users **in November 2016**. During this time, we kept track of user feedback and made adjustments accordingly. After demonstrating the redesign didn't have negative impact on metrics, we gradually rolled the redesign out to everyone.

## Designing for Mobile App
When designing for mobile devices, the major challenge I was facing was how to adapt the information on web to mobile devices and create a consistent cross-platform experience at the same time.

### Iterate and Narrow down
I sketched on paper and made hi-fi prototypes to test the design, and kept iterating until it meet our design goals.

## The impact (App)
The redesign of Profile on Android was launched in Sep 2017, and the iOS version was launched in Feb 2018. For Android, here are the key results:

## What I learned
Design is a never ending process. Along the way, I came across lots of frustrating moments when I couldn't figure out how to take my design to the next level, yet after trial and error I pushed myself and finally found a better solution. Even launch is only a start, we were continuing to learn, iterate and improve upon it.

Also, I reflected on the entire project and thought about where I could do better:
- üîç Validate idea as early as possible with external users.
- üïπ Use better opt-in strategy for web.
- üìê Define more comprehensive measurements for the goals.
