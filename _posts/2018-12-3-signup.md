## Overview
In 2017, we saw the registration and sign in experience of Zhihu was challenged because the existing design has much friction for new users. Our goal was to reduce possible friction throughout the process and drive the conversion.

## My Role
- Led the redesign of the entire sign up & sign process for iOS & Android.

## Where is the Friction

To get a better understanding of the existing process, I did a comprehensive experience audit of Zhihuâ€™s mobile sign up and sign in interface flow. I also observed how people interacted with the existing interfaces, and identified the friction and opportunities throughout the entire journey.

## Learning from Other Apps
Before jumping into designing, I analyzed how other apps designed their sign up and sign in experience.

#### Key Findings:
- Multi-step sign up is applied well to mobile scenario. People can focus on one task at a time and the experience is more smooth.
- Using multi-step sign up has positive impact on increasing conversion rate, because people feel less overwhelmed when the design walks them through the process.

## Design Decisions
### Sign up: One Task at One Time
Informed by the findings in competitive analysis phase, we ran a fast A/B test to validate our assumptions. The result indicated that registration in one step with multiple forms did suffer higher bounce rate compared to registration in multiple steps. Thus we decided to break down sign-up into three steps.

### Sign in: Pull the easiest way out
SMS verification is the easiest and most popular way for people to sign in, but in existing design, the choice was buried in a bottom sheet. To solve the problem, I decided to use two tabs to put both ways.

### Updating the Entire Flow

## Design Solutions

### Less Click times
Previously, there were 5 clicks away to sign up. Now it only needs 2 clicks throughout the process. The multi-step design is more efficient even though the procedure seems longer. People spend less time finishing signing up.

### Unified Structure
I used the Complexion Reduction design language to focus on the key task of each step. By following a shared structure, pages throughout this flow are consistent and clear.

### Be Mindful of Visibility
During user testing I realized a problem. The original sign in button was placed on the bottom of the page, so users couldn't find it right away when they needed it. In the next iteration, I moved the sign in button to the top right corner to make every important elements more visible.

## The Outcome
Our main metric is the overall conversion rate between opening the page and signing up / signing in successfully. After we launched the new design with A/B test, we found that **the sign up conversion rate increased by 8%**, and **the sign in conversion increased by 32%**. Also, people gave us lots of positive feedback for better experience.
