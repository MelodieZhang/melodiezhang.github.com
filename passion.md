I illustrate, write, create, and code.

## I Illustrate

Illustration allows me to blend the real world with the metaphorical. I use Photoshop and Procreate to draw whatever in my mind. Check more of my illustrations on **[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/o_menghan_o/)**.

## I Write
![image](/imgs/passion/writing.jpg)
I'm a believer of "write to think". I like to share my learning and thinking along the way. I write on **[Medium](https://medium.com/@melodiezhang)** and **[Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/melodiezhang)**.

## I Create

In 2017, I collaborated with an engineer to create an Dribbble app for Android as a side project. I designed the UI and experience. The app was available to download on the **[Play Store]()**.

## I Code

2 years ago, I taught myself Swift for iOS platform development and made a simple **[weather app](https://github.com/MelodieZhang/Swift-weather)**. Should designers code? Why not! ðŸ˜†
