# My Passion Project
I illustrate, write and create.

## I Illustrate

Illustration helps me explore visual possibilities about this World. I use Photoshop and Procreate to draw whatever in my mind. Check more of my illustrations on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/o_menghan_o/)~

## I Write

I like to share my learnings and thinkings on product design. Writing is my best way to tell a story and reflect. I write on [Medium](https://medium.com/@melodiezhang) and [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/melodiezhang).

## I Create

In 2017, I collaborated with an engineer to create an Dribbble app for Android as a side project. I designed the UI and experience. The app was available to download on the [Play Store]().

## I Code
